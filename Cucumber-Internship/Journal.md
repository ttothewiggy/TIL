I'll write a little bit here about what I've been learning at Cucumber. It'll serve as a reference guide for myself to keep track of the path I've taken incase I take a wrong turn. 

Today is my first day, I've dived into the analysis tools used here to try and get more familiar with what they can do. The more I can understand the scope of the software, the more I can figure how to utilise it. 

I've started on: 
- Raven SEO Tools
- Raven site auditor studio (branch of Raven tools)
- Google Analytics 4
- TAG Manager
- Looker Studio
- Search Console

And things I need to familiarise myself with are:
- SquareSpace
- HubSpot

Today was spent combing through the cucumber website fixing redirects and wrong links. 
I used Raven software to crawl a website that had fairly recently migrated to a new management software. The crawl flagged a number of errors, including redirects. This was because the old addresses of the links on the website were still being used, even though they had been redirected to the new addresses.

I combed through the website and found all of the links that were using the old addresses. I then changed these links to the new addresses. This will make the website slightly more efficient, as it will no longer need to redirect users from the old addresses to the new ones.

This was a relatively straightforward task, but it was important to ensure that all of the links were changed correctly. I also took the opportunity to review the website's overall structure and make sure that it was still easy to navigate.

I then spent the afternoon doing a variety of linkedIn Leanring courses on the various software I'm trying to master. 
We have:

- **Google Analytics:** Helps track and measure website traffic. It collects data such as visits, views, location, device, browser and behaviour such as clicks, scrolls and loads of other actions. This data can be used to improves website performance, increase conversions (importrant activity such as purchases, game level completion or scroll activity as well as the user doing the thing you made the website for e.g. newsletter download, email signup, free trial sign up, completing survey) and track marketing campaigns. 
- **Google TAG Manager:** tag management system that allows you to add and mange trackig codes on your website. Useful for tracking things like conversions, social media engagement ,email marketing campaigns. 
- **Google Search Console:** is a free service that helps you monitor and maintain your site's presence in Google Search results. It provides data on how your site is performing in search, such as the number of impressions and clicks your site receives, as well as the keywords that people are using to find your site. You can also use Google Search Console to troubleshoot problems with your site's indexing and crawling.
- **Google Looker Studio:** a data visualisation and analysis tool (like Power BI). Can create interactive dashboards and report from data collected from the above sources. Makes it easier to analyse the data and share insights. 

You can use Google Analytics to track the overall traffic to your website, Google Search Console to track the traffic from Google Search, and Google Tag Manager to track the traffic from other sources, such as social media and email marketing campaigns.
Then Google Looker Studio can be used to visualize and analyze the data. 

**How they differ:**

Google Analytics and Google Search Console are both used to track website traffic, but they track different things. Google Analytics tracks all traffic to your website, while Google Search Console only tracks traffic that comes from Google Search.

I've been given a list of various tasks on Google Keep to crack o with.

Rainy day this morning, traffic was terrible. The office is really quiet as a side effect, lots of people WFH. 
But I have my tasks today, which is to continue the list assigned to me. 
I started on Raven crawling both the Cucumebr site and the Bayer site. 
The Cucumber site was done first as it's so much smaller and I finished fixing the link redirects I missed from yesterday, which was a time consuming process. 

The Bayer crawl was done by the time I was finished so I opened that up in the Raven Tools auditor. It has no critical issues, and a higher score than the Cucumber site, but by no means perfect. I've explored all the issues and I'll narrow it down to attempt to fix some of them. I'll check with Nick before I change anything though as I don't want to break the website. 
Nick advised to leave it for now as it was trickier than the cucumber stuff I've been doing for now. 

Instead I compressed a bunch of  large images on the cucumber website and reuplaoded them. Waiting to hear if there's a more efficient way to do it, as there's 1600 over 100kb.

I've begun to use google Bard today, which has been fun. It's got live data pretty much so it's much better to ask current questions. As an AI assistant it's been great.
