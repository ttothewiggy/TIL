I'll write a little bit here about what I've been learning at Cucumber. It'll serve as a reference guide for myself to keep track of the path I've taken incase I take a wrong turn. 

Today is my first day, I've dived into the analysis tools used here to try and get more familiar with what they can do. The more I can understand the scope of the software, the more I can figure how to utilise it. 

I've started on: 
- Raven SEO Tools
- Raven site auditor studio (branch of Raven tools)
- Google Analytics 4
- TAG Manager
- Looker Studio
- Search Console

And things I need to familiarise myself with are:
- SquareSpace
- HubSpot
