### Foundations

## Chapter 1 - Over view of SEO

### What is search engine optimization?

- Search engine optimization (SEO) aims to improve website visibility in search engine results, attracting more relevant visitors.
- Search engines seek to find and deliver relevant and authoritative content to users.
- Relevance in search results is determined by analyzing web page content, code, and external links.
- Search engines understand semantic and thematic connections between words and concepts, allowing for nuanced search results.
- Authority refers to the trustworthiness of content, evaluated through links, references, and reviews from other websites.
- Links act as votes on the internet, with quality and relevance influencing their value.
- Links from reputable and industry-related sites carry more weight than unrelated or low-quality links.
- SEO success depends on improving both relevance and authority, leading to increased search engine exposure and website visits.

### Reading search engine results

- Search engine results pages (SERPs) typically include paid listings and organic/natural results.
- Paid listings are advertisements placed by advertisers through programs like Google Ads or Microsoft Advertising.
- Organic results are not influenced by advertising and appear below or alongside paid listings.
- SERPs can display various types of content, including videos, images, news, products, maps, and more.
- Search engines use algorithms to determine relevant and appropriate results based on user queries.
- Enhanced results like Google's knowledge graph can provide additional information from various sources like Wikipedia and review sites.
- Understanding how search engines display results helps optimize content for higher visibility and ranking.
- Utilizing structured data can further enhance the chances of content appearing in specific result formats.

## Chapter 2 - Keywords: The foundation of SEO

### Planning and researching your SEO keywords

- Keyword research is crucial for SEO and involves discovering relevant search terms users use to find content.
- Start by brainstorming a list of keywords based on the products, services, and problems your website addresses.
- Consider user intent when selecting keywords; focus on terms that align with what users are looking for.
- Use tools like Google Search Console, Google Trends, AnswerThePublic, and Moz's Keyword Explorer to expand your keyword list.
- Evaluate search volume and competition for each keyword; long tail keywords can be valuable with less competition.
- Long tail keywords may have lower search volume individually but can collectively attract significant traffic.
- Organize keywords into themes or categories for easier management and optimization.
- Keyword research is an ongoing process; continuously revisit and refine your target keyword list based on performance and changes in user behavior.

### Analysing SEO keywords and leveraging keyword attributes

- Keyword research tools are essential for exploring and collecting data on relevant keywords.
- Moz Keyword Explorer is one tool that provides search volume, relevancy scores, and competitive metrics for keyword suggestions.
- Long tail keywords can present opportunities with lower competition and specific user intent.
- Google Trends is another useful tool to understand keyword trends over time, geographic interest, and related keyword ideas.
- Data from keyword research tools can be downloaded and analyzed in spreadsheets for further analysis and keyword selection.
- Keyword research is an ongoing process that informs SEO strategy and helps decide which keywords to prioritize for optimization.


### Mapping SEA keywords and leveraging keyword attributes

- Keyword distribution involves assigning target keywords to specific pages on your website.
- Create a spreadsheet to organize your site's pages, keywords, and key optimization components.
- Populate the spreadsheet with existing content and ensure each page targets a unique and relevant keyword.
- Use the spreadsheet to guide content creation and optimization, including URL, title, meta description, and header.
- Revisit the keyword research and mapping process periodically to stay current with trends and adapt to changing needs.
- Consider paid advertising programs to test the performance of certain keywords before investing in long-term organic SEO strategies.
- Continuously improve your keyword and content strategy over time to achieve better results and drive relevant traffic to your website.


## Chapter 3 - Content Optimization for SEO: How Search Engines and People View Webpages

### Outlining Content Optimization

- Content optimization involves improving the quality and relevance of the content on your website continuously.
- Both people and search engines expect clear and trustworthy content.
- Search engines prioritize content that directly matches users' search queries and provides valuable, relevant information.
- Content optimization involves ensuring that your pages are focused on tight, relevant themes and building trust through high-quality, valuable content.
- Search engines reward websites with higher visibility when users engage with and share their content, signaling trustworthiness and relevance.
- When optimizing content, think about how you, as a human, would assess the content's relevance and usefulness, and aim to provide the same value to search engine users.


### Optimizing site structure

- Developing more content for various keywords requires a well-structured website.
- A meaningful site structure helps search engines understand how your pages relate to one another and enables them to return relevant results to searchers.
- Search engines navigate through websites using internal linking, so having a clean internal linking structure is essential for them to find and understand your content.
- A good site structure is like a well-organized bookstore, with clear categories, subcategories, and links guiding visitors to their desired content efficiently.
- Internal linking and site structure are vital for both search engines and users to find and access your content easily.
- A poorly structured website with broken links and confusing navigation can negatively impact search engine understanding and user experience.
- There is no one-size-fits-all site structure; it should be logical and clear to both you and your visitors.
- Search engines aim to emulate human processes, so a well-designed site structure that is easy for people to navigate will be easily understood by search engines as well.


### Optimising on-page elements

- On-page optimization involves fine-tuning the relevance of a page for a specific keyword or search term.
- The first element to optimize is the URL, which should be concise, descriptive, and contain the target keyword.
- The meta title tag is essential and should be around 65 characters, containing the target keyword and a compelling call to action.
- The meta description tag may not directly impact rankings but can improve click-through rates by providing a compelling description of the page's content.
- The H1 header tag, as the main visible headline, should be concise and descriptive, containing the target keyword.
- Content optimization should focus on delivering value to users while naturally incorporating the target keyword and related terms.
- Images can be optimized by renaming the image files and providing descriptive alt text to help both users and search engines understand the content.
- Surrounding readable text can describe non-text elements like images and videos, helping search engines establish topical correlation.
- Structured data can be used to provide relevant metadata for certain types of content, enhancing search engine understanding and potentially leading to rich results in search listings.
- On-page optimization involves optimizing URLs, titles, meta descriptions, headers, body text, and images, as well as providing structured data for non-text elements.
- Regularly reviewing and optimizing existing pages based on keyword research can yield significant improvements in on-page optimization.

## Chapter 4 - Content Optimization: Technical SEO

### Interpreting the code behind webpages

- Search engines crawl webpages to understand their content, but they can't see the visual elements like humans do.
- Webpages are created with code, scripts, and markup that instruct browsers on how to render the page.
- Clean, efficient, and error-free code helps both human users and search engines have a positive experience.
- Metadata, header tags, and structured data provide additional opportunities for search engines to understand content.
- Dynamic elements like animations may not be as transparent to search engines.
- Optimizing your website's code improves on-page optimization and builds trust with search engines.


### Outlining how search engines index content

- Search engines discover new content through crawling links, sitemaps, and following rules set in the robots.txt file.
- Creating internal links within your website helps search engines find and index new content easily.
- Sitemaps, in XML format, provide an organized list of links to all your site's pages, allowing search engines to understand your site structure.
- You can submit sitemaps directly to search engines to notify them of new or updated content.
- The robots.txt file allows you to set rules for search engine crawlers, controlling how they access and crawl your website.
- Use the noindex meta tag to prevent specific pages from appearing in search engine results entirely.
- Monitor your website's uptime and load times to provide a better user experience for search engine users.
- Switching to HTTPS is best practice as it provides security and may be considered a ranking signal by search engines.
- By following these practices, you can ensure that your pages are indexed properly and quickly by search engines.

### Working with canonicle URLs and redirects: Technical SEO

- Duplicate content can occur when multiple URLs point to the same content on a website, potentially dividing SEO efforts.
- URL parameters can cause duplicate content issues when search engines treat similar URLs as separate pages.
- To address duplicate content caused by URL parameters, you can use the rel canonical meta tag to specify the main URL that should be indexed.
- Another way to handle URL parameters is to inform search engines directly through Google's Search Console and Bing's Webmaster Tools.
- Content moves from one location to another can also lead to duplicate content issues, and implementing redirect rules is crucial in such cases.
- Use a 301 (permanent) redirect for long-term content moves to transfer SEO value from the old URL to the new one.
- Avoid using technologies like JavaScript or Meta Refresh Tags for redirects, as they may cause indexing issues with search engines.
- Having unique and properly handled URLs for each page will improve the chances of proper indexing and higher search engine rankings.
