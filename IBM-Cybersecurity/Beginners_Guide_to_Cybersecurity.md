CIA Triad

- Confidentiality - Data is protected from unauthorised access.

Malware Types

- Program viruses are bits of code that insert themselves into another program.
- Macro viruses affect Microsoft Office files via the macros they use to automate tasks.
- Stealth viruses copy themselves to different locations to avoid antivirus scans.
- Polymorphic viruses change their characteristics to get around cybersecurity defenses.
- Ninety-seven percent of all malware uses polymorphic viruses.
- Worms are viruses that start themselves after identifying system weaknesses. They don’t rely on apps or files. Unlike viruses, worms can be controlled remotely.
- Trojans trick you into installing legitimate-seeming software that includes harmful malware.

- Impersonation includes public wifi traps, fake sites, and social engineering.
- Eavesdropping is also called “packet-sniffing.”
- Man-in-the-middle attacks can be physical or logical.
- Replay attacks require trusted entity access tokens.
- A hash is a smaller saved code that is used to store scrambled passwords.
- To preserve data integrity, security plans must prevent unauthorized access and changes.
- DoS and DDoS attacks flood a network with so much traffic that it crashes.
