# Beginners Guide to Cybersecurity Notes

## Module 1

Interesting module outlining information about malware types that was quite informative. 

### CIA Triad

- Confidentiality - Data is protected from unauthorised access. 
- Integrity - Data is protected from unauthorised changes.
- Availability - Authorised data access whenever you need it. 

### Malware Types

- Program viruses are bits of code that insert themselves into another program.
- Macro viruses affect Microsoft Office files via the macros they use to automate tasks.
- Stealth viruses copy themselves to different locations to avoid antivirus scans.
- Polymorphic viruses change their characteristics to get around cybersecurity defenses.
- Ninety-seven percent of all malware uses polymorphic viruses.
- Worms are viruses that start themselves after identifying system weaknesses. They don’t rely on apps or files. Unlike viruses, worms can be controlled remotely.
- Trojans trick you into installing legitimate-seeming software that includes harmful malware.

- Impersonation includes public wifi traps, fake sites, and social engineering.
- Eavesdropping is also called “packet-sniffing.”
- Man-in-the-middle attacks can be physical or logical.
- Replay attacks require trusted entity access tokens.
- A hash is a smaller saved code that is used to store scrambled passwords.
- To preserve data integrity, security plans must prevent unauthorized access and changes.
- DoS and DDoS attacks flood a network with so much traffic that it crashes.


## Module 2

A still fairly informative module with a large amount of common sense practices on top. 

### Password Management Techniques

- 2FA is when a physical device must be plugged in before login.
- MFA is when multiple authentication methods are used to log in.
- SSO verifies a user across connected accounts.
- Password managers create strong, unique passwords and remember them for you.
- Strong passwords are long, random, secret, and never reused.



### Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting

- Role-based access control (RBAC) uses network groups with different permissions levels.
- The methods of authentication are single-factor, two-factor, and multi-factor.
- Authentication factors are something you know, something you have, something you are, and somewhere you are.
- Logs, tracking, cookies, and browsing history are used to troubleshoot and to uncover user activity on devices, and non-repudiation uses video, biometrics, signature, and receipt.

### Hardening Devices

- Apps and OSes should be regularly updated.
- Patches protect against known threats.
- Outdated firmware leaves devices vulnerable.
- Encryption encodes plain text into ciphertext.
- Disabling features and ports reduces attacks.
- Firewalls block traffic, VPNs encrypt traffic.
- Anyone can see what you do on public wifi.
- And hacking a device is easy with default passwords.

### Validation and Device Usage

- Apps, device drivers, and firmware should come from reputable sources.
- Rooting or jailbreaking makes devices vulnerable.
- Apps from filesharing sites are loaded with malware.
- Old apps and bloatware leave devices vulnerable.
- Malicious file removal tools are available for free from reputable antivirus companies, and automatic updates and antivirus, firewall, and VPN software keep devices safe.

### Encryption Concepts

- Encryption scrambles plain text into ciphertext so the data cannot be read.
- Encryption needs keys to encrypt and decrypt data.
- Data at rest is data that resides in storage.
- Data in motion is data that is actively being transmitted and received.
- Symmetric encryption uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data. 
- Asymmetric encryption encrypts with a public key and decrypts with a private key.


### Emails and Spam Management

- Spam is email that's unwanted, unsolicited and comes from people you do not know.
- Hackers use phishing attacks because they're highly effective.
- Phishing uses feelings of fear or urgency to trick you into giving up your personal information.
- Phishing emails have lots of typos and fake links, and links or attachments may install malware.


### Summary & Highlights
- Help keep computers, data, and networks secure with strong passwords, multifactor authentication, and effective policies like avoiding password reuse or sharing. 
- Two-factor and multifactor authentication are extremely effective against phishing attacks and breaches, especially when combined with strong passwords. Restricting permissions and access to data prevents unauthorized viewing, copying, and modification of data. Monitoring server logs and other data can alert IT staff to unusual or suspicious activity and provide helpful forensics when a breach occurs. 
- Applications and operating systems should always be kept up-to-date and patched. Disabling unused services, ports, and default usernames and passwords in devices and software can help eliminate intrusion and exploitation. Firewalls can block unauthorized connections to devices. VPN software and encryption prevent others from capturing usable information from secured and unsecured networks.  
- Software, drivers, patches, and firmware updates should always come from reliable sources like the original manufacturer’s websites. Avoid third-party websites advertising drivers for the latest devices. Uninstall unwanted or unused software so they can’t be exploited. 
- Data that isn’t encrypted is called plain text. Encrypted data is called ciphertext. Data that resides on storage devices is called data at rest.
- Email and data traveling over a network is called data in motion. Data can be encrypted locally on a storage device or during transit over a network connection. 
- Use folders to organize your Inbox and take advantage of built-in email rules to help manage email and junk mail. Be wary of phishing emails that try to trick you into giving up your personal information or login credentials. Suspicious emails typically contain typos, and bad grammar, and try to use intimidation or fear to get you to act on them. Links embedded in suspicious emails are likely to install malware on your device.
