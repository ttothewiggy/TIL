 ### Intro & Chapter 1

Google Analytics is a free tool from Google that's going to let you install a little bit of JavaScript on your site and it's going to unearth a treasure trove of information about your visitors. 
Its all about continued performance through detailed analysis and optimisation. 
It's a process. Perform the measurement, for we can't manage what we can't measure. And apply the analysis, learn from what we see, and then take action.
