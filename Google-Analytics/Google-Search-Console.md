• Impressions:
  - Refers to the number of times a webpage from your site was shown in the search results (SERPs) for a specific search query or keyword.
  - Each time your webpage appears in the search results, it counts as one impression.
  - An impression does not necessarily mean that the user clicked on your link; it merely indicates that your page was visible to the user in the search results.

• Click-through Rate (CTR):
  - CTR is a percentage that shows the ratio of clicks to impressions.
  - Calculated by dividing the number of clicks your webpage receives by the number of impressions it gets and then multiplying by 100.
  - A higher CTR indicates that a higher percentage of users who saw your webpage in the search results clicked on it, suggesting that your snippet and content are relevant and appealing.

• Queries:
  - Also known as search queries or keywords, queries are the terms or phrases that users enter in search engines to find information.
  - The Queries report in Google Search Console shows you which search queries are driving impressions and clicks to your website.
  - This data helps you understand what users are searching for when they find your site.

• Clicks:
  - Clicks represent the number of times users clicked on your webpage's link in the search results.
  - Each click corresponds to a user who visited your site by selecting your link from the search results.
  - Clicks are essential metrics as they directly measure the traffic generated from organic search.

• Average Position:
  - Average position refers to the average ranking of your webpage in the search results for a specific query.
  - Calculated by adding up the positions of your webpage for a particular keyword in different searches and dividing by the number of occurrences.
  - A lower average position indicates that your webpage ranks higher on average for the given keyword.
