# Notes

Today I started the JavaScript 30 day challenge. 
First off is the Drum Kit challenge which has proven really fun. 
I cloned the repo from github containing all the starter code for the challenges and created my own separate repo to push my own work to. I'm just copying and pasting the relevant code accross and removing the temptation of looking at the final code supplied in git repo supplied. 
I'm using the videos online by Wes Bos, the author of this curriculum thing. This first video I'm just coding along but the next challenge I'm planning on trying to figure out more on my own without following the video and then refering to the content if/when I need it.
