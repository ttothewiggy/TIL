While applying for IT jobs I've been noting what employers are asking for, so I can get learning.
I want to crack on with JavaScript, as I've found it to be my favorite coding language so far. I've found it easiest to learn and the most versatile. I'm constantly surprised aobut how much you can do with it. Now I just have to wrap my head around how to do it.  
SQL comes up a lot and I've only briefly touched on it so that is going to be a definite subject to pursue.
My understanding of API's is limited so I want to get familiar with them, as well as cracking on through the Odin Project as I know they address it in that. 
I've started a few courses on LinkdIn - Google Analystics and SEO's as I've asked a friend what his company are looking for so I thought I'd look into it. 
I want to continue the Cisco Networking course I was doing before I left as well. 

Today has been spent getting my computer back up to scratch as I just tried to use git commands and the new Ventura OS seems to have messed with it so I'm reinstalling. 
Once everything is up and running I'll get back on track.

Started the JavaScript 30 day challenge, setting up a google cloud VM instance and getting a website to display on the IP and setting up a google cloud bucket and trying to get a friends domain hosted on it. 
I waited for the DNS to propegate, thinking I had it right but it still doesn't work. I'm going to see if I can link it to the VM instance instead of the bucket. 
Started JavaScript30 day challenge by Wes Bos on Friday and finished day 1's project of JS Drum Kit, and plan to continue Monday.

### Week starting 10/07/23

This week I've continued the JacaScript30 challenge and I'm on day 6. I did a couple a days to make up for not coding over the weekend. 
Had some interesting projects from a clock to a drum kit. 
On top of that I've been cracking on with the Odin project, and finally completed the Foundations part of the course. An underwhelming achievment but I've been trying to complete that since I started at Toi Ohomai 2 years ago and just never gained enough momentum to do it. 
Now I've got the choice to take the path down Ruby on Rails or Full Stack JavaScript. I was curious about Ruby but after looking into it, I think I'll commit to JavaScript as I've gained more understanding in that and it's closer to Python and C# so in my eyes, more relevant. 

As well as this I'm looking at learning the basics of something new. I'm curious about Cyber Security so I'm going to do the IBM Cybersecurity Basics Course on edx.org, or maybe the Beginners Guide to Cybersecurity first, to see what that entails.
