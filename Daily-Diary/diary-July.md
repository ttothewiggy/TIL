While appling for IT jobs I've been noting what employers are asking for, so I can get learning. 
SQL comes up a lot and I've only briefly touched on it so that is going to be a definite subject to pursue.
My understanding of API's is limited so I want to get familiar with them, as well as cracking on through the Odin Project as I know they address it in that. 

I want to continue the Cisco Networking course I was doing before I left as well as pick up where I left off with JavaScript. 

Today ahs been spent getting my computer back up to scratch as I just tried to use git commands and the new Ventura OS seems to have messed with it so I'm reinstalling. 
Once everything is up and running I'll get back on track.
