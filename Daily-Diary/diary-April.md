Today I created a container using a Dockerfile with an old react project inside and managed to get it running with a lot of trial and error, most input was from Abby as well. 
But I've learnt a lot about Dockerfiles and the structure required to get them running as well as troubleshooting them. 
See docker/npm-dockerfile.md for details. 

`docker exec -it <imageID> sh` Allows you to SH into the container and navigate through the files. 

I've also felt quite a large gap in my knowledge when it comes to networking so I've taken some advice from Abby to start a Networking course provided by Cisco. https://www.netacad.com/courses/networking/networking-essentials

Also signed back into Coder for the first time in two weeks, that process goes like:
`coder login coder.ii.nz`
Paste token to cli.
Login using github. 

Spent some time doing a linkdIn learning course on Dockerfiles as well. 

Made this TIL which I really love! Going to try and use this fantastic idea as much as possible.

Today I had a morning meeting with Abby discussing what we'd been up to since last friday at ii. 
She had made a containerised minecraft client for testing which wasn't wuite working but she seemed to have in idea on how to get it running. 
I cloned it from github and tried it out on mac. It built without errors which is great, but it didnt run on the local host so something is still not quite right. 

Since last Friday I haven't done any work towards this project but ahd been focussing on other projects so I had nothing to contribute to the meeting. 

But today I've continued the dockerfile journey, having created a small fun docker container to rick roll someone (on linux only) and now I'm adding lots of info and cheatsheets to this TIL. 

I've also started the cisco networking course.
