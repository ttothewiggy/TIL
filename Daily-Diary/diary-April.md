Today I created a container using a Dockerfile with an old react project inside and managed to get it running with a lot of trial and error, most input was from Abby as well. 
But I've learnt a lot about Dockerfiles and the structure required to get them running as well as troubleshooting them. 
See docker/npm-dockerfile.md for details. 

`docker exec -it <imageID> sh` Allows you to SH into the container and navigate through the files. 

I've also felt quite a large gap in my knowledge when it comes to networking so I've taken some advice from Abby to start a Networking course provided by Cisco. https://www.netacad.com/courses/networking/networking-essentials
