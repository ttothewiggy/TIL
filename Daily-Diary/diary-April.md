Today I created a container using a Dockerfile with an old react project inside and managed to get it running with a lot of trial and error, most input was from Abby as well. 
But I've learnt a lot about Dockerfiles and the structure required to get them running as well as troubleshooting them. 
See docker/npm-dockerfile.md for details. 

`docker exec -it <imageID> sh` Allows you to SH into the container and navigate through the files. 

I've also felt quite a large gap in my knowledge when it comes to networking so I've taken some advice from Abby to start a Networking course provided by Cisco. https://www.netacad.com/courses/networking/networking-essentials

Also signed back into Coder for the first time in two weeks, that process goes like:
`coder login coder.ii.nz`
Paste token to cli.
Login using github. 

Spent some time doing a linkdIn learning course on Dockerfiles as well. 

Made this TIL which I really love! Going to try and use this fantastic idea as much as possible.
