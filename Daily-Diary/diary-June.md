# June

Unfortunately June was a short hiatus as I went to the UK to visit my Mum which allowed me less time to code.
I was still on my course at Toi Ohomai finishing my Level 6 Software Development 2nd year, finishing up projects in my spare time.
I finished my main project to do with Coder, the Windows UWP/C# app and the project management paper while I was in the UK. 

Once they were complete, I unfortunately didn't do any coding while I was away for the whole month of June.
That's on me, but it got kicked from my routine and I struggled to get it back. 

Back in NZ at the end of June and now I'm getting coding into my daily pattern from July onwards.
